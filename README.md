# Marvin's Mirror
## 42's custom voice-controlled personal assistant, built into a mirror for 42 students and guests to explore


### The Interface
As with Alexa, Google Assistant and Siri, Marvin's Mirror is always listening for a wake-up word.

Say "Hey, Marvin!" to open a channel with the Marvin's Mirror. When you see the "listening" gif displayed, you have about ten seconds to speak your command or question.

For help, wake up Marvin and then ask, "What can you do?"
